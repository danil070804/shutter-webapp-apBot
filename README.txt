SHUTTER ISLAND BOT - FIXED EDITION

HOW TO INSTALL:
===============

VARIANT 1 (Recommended):
1. Double-click INSTALL.bat
   (This will download and install all libraries)
2. Edit config.py (set your ADMIN_IDS, ADMIN_CHAT_ID, TOKEN)
3. Run START.bat to launch the bot

VARIANT 2 (Simple):
Just run RUN_SIMPLE.bat - it will install everything and start

IMPORTANT - Edit config.py:
- ADMIN_IDS = (123456789,)  <-- Your ID from @userinfobot
- ADMIN_CHAT_ID = -100...   <-- Your group/chat ID
- TOKEN = "..."             <-- Bot token from @BotFather

- bot.py          - Main bot code (fixed, working)
- config.py       - Settings (EDIT THIS!)
- requirements.txt - Libraries list
- INSTALL.bat     - Installation (run once)
- START.bat       - Normal launch (fast)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If "Python not found" - install Python 3.10+ from python.org
- During Python install, check "Add Python to PATH"
- Right-click .bat files and "Run as Administrator" if errors
